    <h2>Finding Your Voice Again</h2>
    <p>Reclaiming power starts with believing yourself again. Your perception isn’t the problem — the problem is a world terrified of clarity.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Resisting Gaslighting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anchor yourself.</strong> Journal, keep records, trust your senses.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop negotiating your truth.</strong> You don’t need to convince anyone.</li>
      <li><strong>Find your misfits.</strong> One ally can drown out a room of manipulators.</li>
      <li><strong>Use your gift.</strong> Intensity, humor, art — what they tried to erase is your weapon.</li>
      <li><strong>Refuse to shrink.</strong> “Too much” is often just another word for clear.</li>
    </ul>
