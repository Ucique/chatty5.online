    <p>Healing is often marketed as a shiny product — candles, yoga mats, mantras, “good vibes only.” But for those of us who have been gutted by reality, survival doesn’t come wrapped in pastel colors.</p>
    <p>I am <strong>Charlotte Grude</strong>, founder of <strong>Ucique</strong> — and my healing came with cracked bones, near-death encounters, men who nearly destroyed me, and addictions that wanted to finish the job. To pretend otherwise would be another lie.</p>
    <h2>The Challenge of Staying Authentic</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Telling the ugly truth.</strong> That I was abused, nearly killed, and left in ruins.</li>
      <li><strong>Admitting relapse and failure.</strong> Healing isn’t linear, and pretending otherwise is self-betrayal.</li>
      <li><strong>Resisting spiritual bypassing.</strong> No amount of incense can erase scars.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Healing Through Art and Fashion</h2>
    <p>My work uses <strong>print-on-demand clothing</strong> to create sustainably without overproduction — getting designs to people worldwide. Sometimes I <strong>alter my own drawings with AI</strong> to distort, exaggerate, and push them into new grotesque forms. In between, I release <strong>limited editions of my hand-drawn artwork</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is how <em>trauma recovery clothing</em> became <em>sustainable fashion with meaning</em>: wearable honesty for people who don’t fit in.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Healing Without Compromise</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Don’t decorate the truth.</strong> If it’s ugly, let it be ugly. That’s where art begins.</li>
      <li><strong>Use creativity as compost.</strong> Shred the worst moments and grow from them — words, designs, AI-twisted art.</li>
      <li><strong>Find your survival tool.</strong> Mine are dark humor and grotesque creation.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop aiming for “perfect healing.”</strong> There’s no finish line, only honesty.</li>
      <li><strong>Wear your scars.</strong> In your words, your tattoos, or the stories you choose to share.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>What’s one lie you stopped telling yourself to actually heal? How do you keep your recovery authentic?</p>
